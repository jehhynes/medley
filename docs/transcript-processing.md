You are tasked with analyzing customer support transcripts to create a comprehensive knowledge base. Process the provided transcript file and extract information into the following structured categories. 

## Process

1. Arrange the content using primarily prose and complete sentences, and maintaining all of the technical terms, instructions/guidance, and any other information relevant to a knowledge base help article.
2. Split the content into pieces grouped logically by topic, each appropriate for inclusion in a single help article.
3. Avoid duplication. Do not include the same information in multiple fragments.
4. Look for the following categories of content:

## Content Categories

### 1. Tutorial
- Learning-oriented guide that provides hands-on experience to help beginners gain practical understanding of a product or feature through a carefully managed path from start to finish

### 2. How-To
- Task-oriented guide that takes users through a series of sequential steps to solve a specific real-world problem or accomplish a goal

### 3. Concept
- Also known as "explanation", concept articles are understanding-oriented documentation that explains the "why" and "what" behind a topic by providing foundational knowledge, context, background information, connections to other concepts, and use cases—helping readers build a deeper understanding without including step-by-step instructions or reference material.

### 4. Troubleshooting
- Helps users resolve specific problems by describing the symptoms users experience, explaining the root causes of those symptoms, and providing step-by-step solutions or workarounds to fix each issue.

### 5. FAQ
- List questions the customer asked (along with the answer).
- Recurring pain points or confusion areas.
- Document clear, concise answers to common questions.


## Authoring Guidelines

### Content Focus
- Third-party systems and integrations
- Best practices and expert recommendations
- Edge cases, lesser-known features and capabilities, power-user workflows
- Connections between different features or areas in the system
- Not just _what_ features exist, but more importantly, _why_ the system works the way it does, and _how_ to best use it.
- Alternative approaches and when to choose which approach.


### Format Requirements
- Use clear, concise language suitable for end users. Use full sentences to reduce ambiguity.
- Create searchable titles for each entry
- Focus exclusively on user-facing workflows and experiences.
- Do not include content that is specific to a single client, their specific onboarding process, etc.
- Use bulleted and numbered lists sparingly - prefer prose.
- Include all UI elements mentioned (Screens, Menus, Buttons, Form fields, etc)

### Voice & Tone
* **Friendly but professional.** Write as a helpful teammate: clear, confident, never condescending.
* **Use plain language.** Prefer simple words ("use" over "utilize"), avoid jargon unless the audience expects it.
* **Active voice.** "Click Save" not "The Save button should be clicked".
* **Second person.** Address the reader as *you*; refer to the company or system as *we* when needed.
* **Positive framing.** Emphasize what the user *can* do rather than what they cannot.
* **Consistent terminology.** Always use the product’s official names for menus, modules, and settings.

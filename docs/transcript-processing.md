## Authoring Guidelines

### Content Focus
- Third-party systems and integrations
- Best practices and expert recommendations
- Edge cases, lesser-known features and capabilities, power-user workflows
- Connections between different features or areas in the system
- Not just _what_ features exist, but more importantly, _why_ the system works the way it does, and _how_ to best use it.
- Alternative approaches and when to choose which approach.


### Format requirements:
- Use clear, concise language suitable for end users. Use full sentences to reduce ambiguity.
- Create searchable titles and keywords for each entry
- Focus exclusively on user-facing workflows and experiences.
- Do not include content that is specific to a single client, their specific onboarding process, etc.
- Use bulleted and numbered lists sparingly - prefer prose.
- Include all UI elements mentioned (Screens, Menus, Buttons, Form fields, etc)

### Voice & Tone
* **Friendly but professional.** Write as a helpful teammate: clear, confident, never condescending.
* **Use plain language.** Prefer simple words ("use" over "utilize"), avoid jargon unless the audience expects it.
* **Active voice.** "Click Save" not "The Save button should be clicked".
* **Second person.** Address the reader as *you*; refer to the company or system as *we* when needed.
* **Positive framing.** Emphasize what the user *can* do rather than what they cannot.
* **Consistent terminology.** Always use the product’s official names for menus, modules, and settings.
